			<h4>NYC PM2.5</h4>
			<p>The air pollution data comes from the New York City Community Air Survey, which details air quality trends from 19 to 21 in various areas of New York, including pm2.5 and more. Poor air quality can cause various effects such as
                Coughing
                Tightness in the chest
                Worsening of asthma
                Reduced lung function
                Increased risk of heart attack and stroke
                Low birthweight in newborns.<br/>

                Today, with the support of New York City's OneNYC programme (New York City's long-term sustainability plan), emissions of all types of air pollution are declining year after year, thanks to the use of cleaner energy sources, as well as greening of the city and changes in the way people get around, all of which contribute to better air quality.</p>

		<h4>NYC Air Quality Map</h4>
		<p>In the map we can clearly see that the air quality in the Manhattan area of New York City is very bad, 
            but over time the PM2.5 levels in New York City as a whole are decreasing, 
            reflecting the "low carbon" future of urban life.</p>
