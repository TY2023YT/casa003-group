        <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
        <h3>To Build an Eco-friendly Living Area</h3>
        <p>Our goal is to explore how citizens will live in cities in the future. 
            We would like to explore the direction of urban development and how citizens will live in the city in the future through the four sectors of air quality, 
            green space, shared mobility and solar energy.<br/>

            These four sectors were chosen because we believe that this is the future trend of urban development, 
            that is, to create a green, low-carbon and efficient living area. In the future, 
            some energy sources that may cause air pollution will be replaced by cleaner energy sources, such as solar energy. 
            The improvement of air quality will also lead to more greenery and parks in the city, 
            which will purify the air and encourage people to travel at the same time. 
            Good air quality and the spread of greenery and parks will attract people to walk on short trips or use shared bikes, 
            reducing carbon emissions and creating a virtuous cycle.</p>
