			<h4>1,000 megawatts goal by 2030</h4>
			<p>New York City aims to install 1,000 megawatts of solar across the city by 2030, enough to power 250,000 homes. 
                Solar panels enable buildings to generate their own emissions-free electricity and save residents money by reducing the amount of electricity they need to purchase from utility companies. On-site and community solar generation can help reduce grid energy consumption, 
                especially when combined with energy storage, which can help shift peak consumption.
                In addition, the city uses municipal properties to install solar and is committed to installing 100 megawatts of rooftop solar on city-owned buildings by 2025, 
                reducing greenhouse gas emissions from city-owned buildings and operations by 50% by 2030. (50% reduction compared to 2005 levels)<br/>
                Solar deployment has grown substantially in New York City in the past decade. As of Summer 2022, 
                there were 350 megawatts installed, which can produce enough energy to cover approximately 90,000 average NYC householdsâ€™ electric bills.
